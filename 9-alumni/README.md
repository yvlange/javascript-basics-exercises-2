# Exercise 9: Alumni

Let's use a JavaScript object to model an Alumni.
Create 3 objects that contains the data defined in the requirements for 3 different Alumni
(you can invent them, be creative).

Then, create a function called `displayAlumni` that accepts an object as parameter
representing the alumni and make it log to the console the following:

```
Name: Namir
Surname: Sayed-Ahmad Baraza
Age: 30
Previous Experience: freelancing, veridata, quantilope // here show none if empty
Education: MsC in Computer Science
isLearningJavaScript: yes
```

## Requirements

- `name` (string)
- `surname` (string)
- `age` (number)
- `previousExperience` (array of strings with names to previous jobs, if any. Otherwise empty)
- `education`
- `isLearningJavaScript` (boolean)
